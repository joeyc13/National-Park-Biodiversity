Data Analysis of Species in US National Parks

This project consist of data analytics on observations of species in the US National Parks. The primary objective of this project was to see how biodiversity and conservation status are related.

My analysis, visualizations, and conclusions are located in the PDF of a slide show I made to present the this topic. 

My code and comments during my analysis are in the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb). 

The data visuals I created for this analysis are also listed here as .png files
